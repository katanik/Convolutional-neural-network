<html>Simple <b>Java</b> application that includes a class with <code>main()</code> method.
<p>It is implementation of <b>convolutional neural network</b> usage to classify test images into 3 classes.<br>The current version runs already learned network.<br>It will display windows with all the input images (from "test_data" folder) one by one.</p>
<p>Probability percentages are shown under images for the following classes: tree, swan, cloud.<br>The CNN weights are already serialized in the current version, but you can recalculate it.<br>In the main() function you can uncomment functions calls for processing images data, applying Gabor filter and learning CNN.</p>
