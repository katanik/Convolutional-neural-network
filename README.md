# Convolutional neural network classifier
Simple Java application that includes a class with main() method.
It is implementation of convolutional neural network usage to classify test images into 3 classes.
The current version runs already learned network.
It will display windows with all the input images (from "test_data" folder) one by one.

Probability percentages are shown under images for the following classes: tree, swan, cloud.
The CNN weights are already serialized in the current version, but you can recalculate it.
In the main() function you can uncomment functions calls for processing images data, applying Gabor filter and learning CNN.
